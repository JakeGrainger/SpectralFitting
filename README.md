# Spectral Fitting
Currently contains two main features: a MATLAB toolbox for fitting spectral models, and scripts to generate the figures to accompany Grainger et. al. (2020)
## Spectral Fitting Toolbox

### Installation
The toolbox can be installed by downloading and running 'Spectral Fitting Toolbox.mltbx'.
### Usage
See the documentation in MATLAB for usage instructions.

## Figures for "Estimating the parameters of ocean wave spectra."
Figures from the paper can be generated using the scripts provided in the spectralFittingPaper folder.
### Installation
First ensure that Spectral  Fitting Toolbox is intalled.
Download the folder spectralFittingPaper and add to the MATLAB path.
### Usage
To run a script, add the relevant subfolder to the path and run as usual.
