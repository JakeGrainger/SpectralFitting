            Spectral Fitting Toolbox includes a variety of different features, including model fitting, simulation and non-parametric spectral density estimation.

                The main purpose of Spectral Fitting Toolbox is to enable the user to fit models for the spectral density function of a continuous time stochastic process to observed data.
                Spectral Fitting Toolbox comes with a variety of different techniques for achieving this.
                These range from curve fitting techniques such as least squares, to quasi-likelihoods such as the De-biased Whittle likelihood.

                Spectral Fitting Toolbox requires the user to provide a parametric form for the spectral density function of the continuous time stochastic process.
                The user may also specifify the spectral density of the sampled, discrete time, process; or the autocovariance.
                However, Spectral Fitting Toolbox also has procedures to approximate these directly from the spectral density function of the continuous time process.

            <p>
                As a secondary feature, Spectral Fitting Toolbox also allows the user to simulate Gaussian processes with a defined spectral density function.
                Simulated processes simulate the Gaussian process that would arise from sampling a continuous time Gausssian process, with a given spectral density function, at a sampling interval defined by the user.

            <h2>Non-parametric spectral density estimation</h2><hr />
            <p>
                Additionally, Spectral Fitting Toolbox also provides the user with classes to perform non-parametric estimation of the spectral density function.
                These classes include methods to easily visualise the obtained estimate.
