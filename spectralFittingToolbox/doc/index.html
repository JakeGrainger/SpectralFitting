            Spectral Fitting Toolbox is designed to enable the user to perform parameteric estimation of the spectral density function for second-order stationary stochastic processes.
        </p><br />
        <p>
            Spectral Fitting Toolbox comes preloaded with parametric spectral density functions for some stoachastic processes, including for wind-generated waves. However, you can also specify your own parameteric spectral density function if you wish. Analytical parametric forms for related quantities, such as the autocovariance, can also be specified. If they are not, they will be approximated numerically.
